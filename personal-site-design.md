My sites primary purpose is to let people know who I am, and give them some insight into the kind of person I am and what I believe.
My target audience is anyone really. Friends, colleagues, family. Whoever wants to see it.
I just want the people who go to my site to be able to navigate easily/not get lost or too distracted. I just want it to be a very streamlined experience with all the information that anyone could want from my site easy to find and read.
Iâ€™m going to make sure I have a nice simple layout, with a lot of white space and minimal distraction. I want it to be clean, but still kind of friendly and not too sterile.
