When the screen-size is reduced below 550px, the elements on the page are rearranged
to stack on top of each other, making one vertical column of content.
To do that sort of thing you have to use media queries!
Basically if certain conditions are met, then the browser is told to display things
differently. So the webpage asks the browser what size it is, and if it's within
the specified parameters, it'll change!
